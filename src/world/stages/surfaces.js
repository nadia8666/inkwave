// Registry of every stage's surface materials (src/world/stages/<id>/surfaces.js) for texlib.js + levelMaterial.js.
// PATTERN slots 0–27 are the shared kit (mapkit.js); each stage owns three slots from 28 up (STAGE_SLOTS below). The
// slots only exist in the shader's slot table. Imports only the surfaces files (no props / layout), so texlib.js never
// pulls in stage geometry.
